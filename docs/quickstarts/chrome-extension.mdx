<Steps>

### Configure your authentication options

This tutorial only supports the [email & password](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#authentication-strategies), [email & email code](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#one-time-password-otp), and [SMS & SMS code](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#one-time-password-otp) authentication options.

For more information on what authentication options are supported and how to enable them, see [Chrome Extension Authentication Options](/docs/references/chrome-extension/overview)

Please ensure you have the correct authentication options enabled/disabled in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=authentication).

### Set up a React application using Vite

Scaffold your new React application using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  ```bash filename="terminal"
  npm create vite@latest clerk-chrome-extension -- --template react-ts
  cd clerk-chrome-extension
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  yarn create vite clerk-chrome-extension --template react-ts
  cd clerk-chrome-extension
  yarn install
  yarn dev
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  pnpm create vite clerk-chrome-extension --template react-ts
  cd clerk-chrome-extension
  pnpm install
  pnpm dev
  ```

</CodeBlockTabs>

### Install the CRXJS Plugin

The CRXJS plugin is a Vite plugin that helps with Chrome Extension development. It provides a way to build and package your Chrome Extension, and also helps with hot reloading. To install the plugin, follow the instructions on the [CRXJS Plugin](https://crxjs.dev/vite-plugin/getting-started/react/create-project) page.

### Install `@clerk/chrome-extension`

Clerk's [Chrome Extension SDK](/docs/references/chrome-extension/overview) gives you access to prebuilt components, React hooks, and helpers to make user authentication easier.

Add the SDK to your project:

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn",  "pnpm" ]}>
  ```bash filename="terminal"
  npm install @clerk/chrome-extension
  ```
  ```bash filename="terminal"
  yarn add @clerk/chrome-extension
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  pnpm add @clerk/chrome-extension
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Set your environment variables

<SignedIn>

Add the following keys to your `.env` file. These keys can always be retrieved from the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page of your Clerk Dashboard.

</SignedIn>

<SignedOut>

1. Navigate to the Clerk Dashboard.
2. In the navigation sidebar, select [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys).
3. In the **Quick Copy** section, select **Chrome Extension** and copy your Clerk publishable and frontend API key.
4. Paste your keys into your `.env` file.

The final result should resemble the following:

</SignedOut>

  <InjectKeys>

  ```sh filename=".env.local"
  VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  CLERK_FRONTEND_API={{fapi_url}}
  ```

  </InjectKeys>

### Add `<ClerkProvider>` to your app

All Clerk hooks and components must be children of the [`<ClerkProvider>`](/docs/components/clerk-provider) component, which provides active session and user context.

To make this data available across your entire app, wrap your app in the `<ClerkProvider>` component. You **must** pass your publishable key as a prop to the `<ClerkProvider>` component.

```jsx filename="src/main.tsx" {5, 7-12, 16, 18}
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App.tsx";
import "./index.css";
import { ClerkProvider } from "@clerk/chrome-extension";

// Import your publishable key
const PUBLISHABLE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY;

if (!PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {
  throw new Error("Missing Publishable Key");
}

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ClerkProvider publishableKey={PUBLISHABLE_KEY}>
      <App />
    </ClerkProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
);
```

### Create a header with Clerk components

You can control which content signed in and signed out users can see with Clerk's [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview). To get started, create a header for your users to sign in or out. With chrome extensions, you can also add this logic to a footer. To do this, you will use:

- [`<SignedIn>`](/docs/components/control/signed-in): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed in**.
- [`<SignedOut>`](/docs/components/control/signed-out): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed out**.
- [`<UserButton />`](/docs/components/user/user-button): A prebuilt component that comes styled out of the box to show the avatar from the account the user is signed in with.
- [`<SignInButton />`](/docs/components/unstyled/sign-in-button): An unstyled component that links to the sign-in page or displays the sign-in modal.

```jsx filename="src/App.tsx" {2-7, 12-19}
import "./App.css";
import {
  SignInButton,
  SignedIn,
  SignedOut,
  UserButton,
} from "@clerk/chrome-extension";

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <header className="header">
        <SignedOut>
          <SignInButton mode="modal" />
        </SignedOut>
        <SignedIn>
          <UserButton />
        </SignedIn>
      </header>
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Load your Chrome Extension into your Chromium-based browser

The CRXJS plugin that you installed facilitates Chrome Extension development by automatically "hot building" the application while it runs. This ensures the `dist/` folder remains up to date. Without the plugin, you would need to manually execute the build command and reload your Chrome Extension after each change. The CRXJS plugin automates this process, streamlining development.

With your application running, please do the following:

1. Open Chrome or a Chromium-based browser and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
1. Locate the **Developer mode** toggle, which is usually in the upper right corner, and enable it.
1. Select the **Load unpacked** button, which is usually in the upper left corner.
1. Navigate to where your project is located and select the `dist/` folder. Then select the **Select** button.
1. Your extension will now be loaded and shown in the list of extensions on the `chrome://extensions` page.

### Test your Chrome Extension

In your Chrome browser, open the extension popup. Ensure that the `<SignIn />` button appears, and that selecting it opens the Clerk sign-in modal. Sign in and ensure that the `<UserButton />` appears in the header.

### Next Steps

Developing a Chrome Extension poses several challenges. We have provided guides to help overcome those, and encourage you to go through each of them.

1. [Configure a consistent key](/docs/references/chrome-extension/configure-consistent-key)
2. [Enable `sessionSyncWithTab`](/docs/references/chrome-extension/syncsessionwithtab-configuration)
3. [Add React Router](/docs/references/chrome-extension/add-react-router)
