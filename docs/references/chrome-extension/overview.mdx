---

Clerk provides a Chrome Extension SDK that allows you to easily integrate Clerk into your Chrome Extension. This SDK provides a simple way to authenticate users and manage their sessions.

## Authenication Options

The authentication options for a Chrome Extension will differ depending on how the extension is configured. Please consult the following table and information to determine the option available.

- **Popup** - The default popup behaviour of a Chrome Extension
- **Side Panel** - A Chrome Extension configured and opened in a Side Panel
- **`syncSessionWithTab`** - A Chrome Extension deployed along with a web application, and use using `syncSessionWithTab` to sync the auth state from the web application to the extension.

| | Popup | Side Panel | `syncSessionWithTab` |
| - | - | - | - |
| Email + OTP | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Email + Link | | | ✅ |
| Email + Password | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Username + Password | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| SMS + OTP | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| OAuth | | | ✅ |
| Google One Tap | | | ✅ |
| SAML | | | ✅ |
| Passkeys | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Web3 | | | ✅ |

> [!WARNING]
> Our Chrome Extension SDK currently does not fully support `syncSessionTab` on side panels. The side panel would need to be closed and then reopened to update the authentication status

## Chrome Extension CRX Id

A Chrome Extension can be identified by its unique Id, in a similar way to how a website can be identified by its domain. You will need to explicitly configure your Chrome Extension's CRX ID or it will change often. If the key changes, it can cause the Chrome Extension to fail. See the [Configure a consistent key](/docs/references/chrome-extension/configure-consistent-crx-id) guide for more information.

## `syncSessionWithTab`

If you have a web application that you want synced with your Chrome Extension, Clerk provides a `syncSessionWithTab` feature. As soon as a user authenticates in your web application, the user will be authenticated in your Chrome Extension as well. See the [`syncSessionWithTab` configuration](/docs/references/chrome-extension/syncsessionwithtab-configuration) guide for more information.

## Add React Router

[Add React Router to your Chrome Extension](/docs/references/chrome-extension/add-react-router) to enable routing in your application.

## Deploying your extension

See our [deployment guide](/docs/deployments/deploy-chrome-extension) for Chrome Extensions for information about deploying your extension.
