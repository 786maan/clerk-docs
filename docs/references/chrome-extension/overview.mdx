Clerk provides a Chrome Extension SDK that allows you to easily integrate Clerk into your Chrome Extension. This SDK provides a simple way to authenticate users and manage their sessions.

## Authenication Options

Depending on whether the user is signing into the Chrome Extension or into web app application and their authentication state is being synced with `syncSesstionWithTab`, the authentication options are different. Please refer to the chart to see what authentication options are available depending on how users can log into the extension.

## Chrome Extension Key

A Chrome Extension can be identified by its unique ID, in a similar way to how a website can be identified by its domain. You will need to explicitly configure your Chrome Extension's key or it will change often. If the key changes, it can cause the Chrome Extension to fail. See the [Configure a consistent key](/docs/references/chrome-extension/configure-consistent-key) guide for more information.

## `syncSessionWithTab`

If you have a web application that you want synced with your Chrome Extension, Clerk provides a `syncSessionWithTab` feature. As soon as a user authenticates in your web application, the user will be authenticated in your Chrome Extension as well. See the [`syncSessionWithTab` configuration](/docs/references/chrome-extension/syncsessionwithtab-configuration) guide for more information.

## Add React Router

[Add React Router to your Chrome Extension](/docs/references/chrome-extension/add-react-router) to enable routing in your application.

## Deploying your extension

See our [deployment guide](/docs/deployments/deploy-chrome-extension) for Chrome Extensions for information about deploying your extension.
