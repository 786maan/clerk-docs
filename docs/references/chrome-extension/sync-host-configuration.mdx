title: Sync Host configuration
description: Learn how to configure your Chrome Extension to sync user authentication with your web application.
---

The Sync Host feature enables your user's session in your web application to be synced with your Chrome Extension. As soon as a user authenticates in your web application, the user will be authenticated in your Chrome Extension as well.

<Steps>
  ### Add `CLERK_SYNC_HOST` to your environment variables

  To enable Sync Host, add the `PLASMO_PUBLIC_CLERK_SYNC_HOST` environment variable to your `.env.production` and `.env.development` files. The value will be the URL of your production application or development application. If you are using a Vite based React application, then you would likely use `http://localhost:5173`.

  {/* TODO: Alexis, maybe tabs for .env.development and .env.production? */}
  ```tsx {{ filename: '.env.development', mark: [3], prettier: false }}
  PLASMO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_
  CLERK_FRONTEND_API=  
  PLASMO_PUBLIC_CLERK_SYNC_HOST=http://localhost:5173
  ```
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > You can alternatively use the `syncHost` prop for `<ClerkProvider>`. If you do this you will need to make this value is accurate for development or production builds.


  ### Configure `host_permissions`

  `host_permissions` allows you to specify which hosts, or websites, will have permission to sync auth state with your application. It accepts an array, allowing you to add more than one host.

  The values for your web application and of the Clerk Frontend API will be different for development and production. Using `.env.development` and `.env.production` will allow you to pass those values to your development and production builds seamlessly.

  1. Open your `manifest.json` file and edit the `host_permissions` key.
  1. Remove `http://localhost/*` or similiar is present and replace with `$PLASMO_PUBLIC_CLERK_SYNC_HOST/*`. 

  The following examples shows how to configure `host_permissions`:

  ```json {{ filename: '/package.json' }}
  "manifest": {
    "permissions": [
      "cookies",
      "storage"
    ],
    "host_permissions": [
      "$PLASMO_PUBLIC_CLERK_SYNC_HOST/*",
      "$CLERK_FRONTEND_API/*"
    ],
    "key": "$CRX_PUBLIC_KEY"
  }
  ```

  ### Configure `permissions`

  `permissions` allows you to specify which permissions your extension requires.

  1. Open your `manifest.json` file and add the `permissions` key.
  1. Add `"cookies"` and `"storage"` to the array as shown in the following example:

  ```json {{ filename: '/package.json' }}
  {
    // ... the rest of your package.json
    "permissions": ["cookies", "storage"]
  }
  ```

  ### Add the Extension's ID to your instance's `allowed_origins`

  For web applications, Clerk requires you to set a **domain** in your Clerk Dashboard. For Chrome Extensions, the **extension ID** is used _instead_ of a domain. You must add this to your application's settings via the Backend API instead of the Clerk Dashboard.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Completing the steps from the [Configure a consistent key](/docs/references/chrome-extension/configure-consistent-key) guide will prevent you from having to do this repeatedly.

  <SignedIn>
    In your terminal, paste the following command and replace the `<CHROME_EXTENSION_KEY>` with your extension's ID.
  </SignedIn>

  <SignedOut>
    1. Navigate to the Clerk Dashboard.
    1. In the navigation sidebar, select [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys).
    1. Copy your secret key.
    1. In your terminal, paste the following command and replace `YOUR_SECRET_KEY` with your Clerk secret key, and the `<CHROME_EXTENSION_KEY>` with your extension's ID.

    The final result should resemble the following:
  </SignedOut>

  ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
  curl -X PATCH https://api.clerk.com/v1/instance \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer {{secret}}" \
    -H "Content-type: application/json" \
    -d '{"allowed_origins": ["chrome-extension://<CHROME_EXTENSION_ID>"]}'
  ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > Make sure that you use the Chrome Extension ID and not the Key with the above command.

  Running the command will add the extension's ID to your instance's `allowed_origins`.
