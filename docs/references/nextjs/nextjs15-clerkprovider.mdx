title: 'Nextjs 15 `<ClerkProvider>`'
description: Access minimal authentication data for managing sessions and data fetching.
---

The `<ClerkProvider>` component wraps your Next.js application and provides authentication context to manage user authentication and authorization. Starting from `@clerk/nextjs v6`, `<ClerkProvider>` no longer forces dynamic rendering across your entire app by default, supporting Next.js best practices such as Partial Prerendering (PPR).

To access dynamic authentication data, use the `auth()` helper in Server Components or pass it directly to Client Components as needed. For Client Components relying on hooks like `useAuth()` during server-side rendering, the new `<ClerkDynamicProvider>` component allows you to selectively load dynamic auth data only when necessary. This approach is more optimized for PPR, giving you control over when and where dynamic auth data is accessed.

#### Use `<ClerkProvider>` for Static and Dynamic Data

By default, `<ClerkProvider>` provides static authentication support. If your app relies on dynamic authentication data, such as client-side hooks, you should use `<ClerkDynamicProvider>` in conjunction with Suspense to manage loading states while ensuring efficient data fetching for Partial Prerendering.

Example usage with `<ClerkDynamicProvider>` and `<Suspense>`:

```tsx
import { Suspense } from 'react'
import { ClerkDynamicProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <main>
      <header>
        <Logo />
        <Suspense fallback={<FallbackAvatar />}>
          <ClerkDynamicProvider>
            <UserAvatar />
          </ClerkDynamicProvider>
        </Suspense>
      </header>
    </main>
  )
}
```

#### Opt into Dynamic Rendering with the dynamic Prop

If you want `<ClerkProvider>` to enable dynamic rendering for authentication data by default, simply add the dynamic prop. This will make dynamic auth data available throughout your entire application without needing `<ClerkDynamicProvider>`. When the dynamic prop is set, all pages are opted into PPR where possible.

Example:

```tsx
import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider dynamic>
      <html>
        <body>{children}</body>
      </html>
    </ClerkProvider>
  )
}
```

#### Prerendering and Dynamic Data

Even when using the dynamic prop, `<ClerkProvider>` supports PPR out of the box. It is recommended to adopt a more granular approach, using the auth() helper and `<ClerkDynamicProvider>` where necessary, to optimize for both performance and dynamic data needs.

For the best results with Next.js, use auth() in Server Components or Route Handlers to access authentication data, and reserve `<ClerkDynamicProvider>` for Client Components that rely on dynamic data.
