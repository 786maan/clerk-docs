# Deploy a Chrome Extension

## Add production domain to `host_permissions`

`host_permissions` allows you to specify which hosts, or websites, will have permission to sync auth state with your application. It accepts an array, allowing you to add more than one host.

1. Open your `manifest.json` file and add the `host_permissions` key if it does not already exist.
1. Add your domain and ensure it is preceded with `https://`. For example, `https://clerk.com`. Only add the root domain and not subdomains.

The following examples shows how to configure `host_permissions` for production:

```json filename="/manifest.json" {5-7}
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "Clerk Chrome Extension Quickstart",
  // ... the rest of your manifest
  "host_permissions": [
    "https://clerk.com"
  ]
}
```

## Create a Production instance

For Clerk production instances, there must be a domain associated with the instance. Even though there may not be a web application associated with the Chrome Extension, a domain is still required. Please read the [Deploy your Clerk app to production](/docs/deployments/overview) guide for more information.

## Add the Extension's ID to your instance's `allowed_origins`

For web applications, Clerk requires you to set a **domain** in your Clerk Dashboard. For Chrome Extensions, the **extension ID** is used *instead* of a domain. You must add this to your application's settings via the Backend API instead of the Clerk Dashboard.

1. Navigate to the Clerk Dashboard.
1. Ensure that your production instance is selected in the top of the Dashboard.
1. In the navigation sidebar, select [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys).
1. Copy your secret key. It should begin with `sk_live_`.
1. In your terminal, paste the following command and replace `<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>` with your Clerk secret key, and the `<CHROME_EXTENSION_KEY>` with your extension's ID.

The final result should resemble the following:

```bash filename="terminal"
curl  -X PATCH https://api.clerk.com/v1/instance \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_SECRET_KEY>" \
      -H "Content-type: application/json" \
      -d '{"allowed_origins": ["chrome-extension://<CHROME_EXTENSION_KEY>"]}'
```

Running the command will add the extension's ID to your instance's `allowed_origins`.

## Update your application's keys

Ensure that you updated your `.env` file to use your Clerk production key. It should begin with `pk_live_` instead of `pk_test_`.

## Submit your extension for review

1. In your application, create a new zip of `dist/` folder. Upload this to the Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard.
1. In the Privacy tab, locate the **Permission justification** section. Inside of there is a section called **Are you using remote code?**. For this section you will need to indicate that you are using remote code. Clerk loads the `@clerk/clerk-js` package from a CDN and it is not included in the extension.
1. Submit for review in the Chrome Developer Dashboard.
